# Introduction

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been thinking of an idea for some time now - to create a small web game solely for educational purposes. However, game design can be a challenging task, and at the moment my priorities lie more on a technical side of things, so I decided to create a clone of an existing game, maybe just a little bit modified to make things more interesting. I have chosen The Witcher 3 Gwent minigame to experiment upon, since I know the rules more or less and it is quite popular, so are there information about it on the internet easy to search for.
	
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My main focus will be on the backend or API initially, with frontend development being probably a separate project.	For educational purposes, I plan to create an overengineered version of the game and the knowledge gathered will serve me as a foundation for future projects.
	
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to put much emphasis on quality attributes, so I am going to actively develop a well organized technical specification document. Besides it I am also writing this article in a form of blog post, so I can present my thought process in a natural language.

## Initial Design

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First I will focus on generally describing what's in my mind in this section. I'll be more or less basing on [arc42](https://arc42.org/overview), which gives some tips on how to document a software, as well as [ISO Standard 25010](https://iso25000.com/index.php/en/iso-25000-standards/iso-25010) for quality attributes.
